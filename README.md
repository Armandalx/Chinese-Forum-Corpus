# Dateset Description

Chiphell is a web portal where netizens share their views to news and discuss within groupuscule. We have collected discussion forums from several subjects, such as computer hardware, motors and clothes. There are more than 50 thousand discussions in the corpus. Similar with the DouBan DuShu corpus, most of the sentences collected from Chiphell are informal Chinese and some of them are in special domains.

An example from each subject is shown in the following table:


| Subject 	| Topic 	| Example 	|
|-------------------	|---------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| News 	| 美机场航空业希望修改客机降落的Emoji表情：机头朝下不吉利 	| 那我还说改完的意思是无限复飞呢,飞到没油不又gg了 	|
| Computer Hardware 	| 请问现在大船货除开3610还有其他性价比的大船大容量吗 	| 我1T的PM1633。。卖1300都木有人接 	|
